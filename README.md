# javascript-framework <br/>

This simple JavaScript framework allows users to view weather forecasts for different cities. The app fetches data from a list of objects (not real-time weather data from an API) and lets users select between multiple cities to view their current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and conditions (sunny, rainy, etc.). The interface is user-friendly, with a dropdown or to select the city, and a clean, responsive design to display the weather information. This project demonstrates the use of asynchronous data fetching, DOM manipulation, and simple UI elements to create a functional and interactive web app.
